Ally codes is a comma-separated string(like: 123456789,125456189 ...).

You will need to create a Discord web hook in the channel of choice.
Fill the `DISCORD_WEB_HOOK` with the that unique url.

Choose your arena type - `SQUAD` or `FLEET`.

`GAME_CLIENT_VERSION` is not required at first but will help to fix connection
issues when the game client will be updated again(happens from time to time).
Check the application logs if the tracker stops sending messages.

### 6. Activate the resource to run the tracker under the `Resources tab`.
